### Ubetcha

## Description

This project is a wager application where a user can bet with other users on upcoming sports events. Sports news is added to the app to make more informed bets.

## Usage

 - Initially on the home screen you may look at upcoming sporting events or the news headlines without logging in. The user may then sign up or log in to access betting functionality. Once signed up, each user begins with 100 credits. On the Bet page, the user will enter an amount based on the team of the event they have chosen. 

 - Once confirmed, the user will wait for another user to take the other half of the wager. Then, when both parties are set in their bet, future functionality will allow the app to send notifications to their email addresses.

 - The APIs surrounding sports events and odds are innately expensive, so the confirmation of the winners of the games isn't functional yet.
